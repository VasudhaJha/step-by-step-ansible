## **Introduction**

Ansible is a powerful, open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. If youâ€™ve ever felt overwhelmed by tutorials that jump around or if youâ€™re stuck in "tutorial purgatory," this repository is for you.

This project will guide you through a **task-based** approach to learning Ansible, one step at a time. Each "level" builds on the previous one, covering key concepts and providing actionable tasks to solidify your understanding.

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- **Basic knowledge of Linux commands**
- Familiarity with **SSH and text editors** (like `vim` or `nano`)
- Basic knowledge of **Docker** (since we will be using Docker containers for setting up our environment)

## **Levels Overview**

### **Level 1: Getting Started with Ansible**

- **Objective: Learn basic Ansible commands and test connections.**

- Topics Covered:
  - Installing Ansible
  - Understanding the control node and managed nodes
  - SSH key-based authentication
  - Ansible Inventory

- Tasks:
  - Set Up Your Ansible Environment
  - Create your inventory file
  - Run your first ansible ping command

### **Level 2: Configuration Management (ansible.cfg)**

- **Objective: Understand how to configure Ansible settings for ease of use.**

- Topics Covered:
  - Ansible Configuration file

- Tasks:
  - Create a custom ansible.cfg file and run the ansible ping command

### **Level 3: Running Commands on Managed Nodes**

- Objective: Learn to execute shell commands on managed nodes using ad-hoc Ansible commands.

- Topics Covered:
  - Using the command and shell modules
  - Understanding differences between the command and shell modules

- Tasks:
  - Run the uptime command on all managed nodes
  - Create and delete a temporary file using the command module

### **Level 4: Copying Files to Managed Nodes**

- Objective: Learn how to copy files from the control node to managed nodes.

- Topics Covered:
  - Using the copy module to transfer files
  - Understanding file permissions and ownership

- Tasks:
  - Copy a "hello.txt" file to /tmp/ on all managed nodes
  - Verify the contents of the file on one of the managed nodes

### **Level 5: Writing Playbooks**

- **Objective: Understand how to create and execute playbooks for automating tasks.**

- Topics Covered:
  - YAML syntax for Ansible playbooks
  - Defining tasks, hosts, and handlers

- Tasks:
  - Write a playbook to update the system packages on managed nodes
  - Add tasks to clean up old logs from /var/log

### **Level 6: Using Variables in Playbooks**

- **Objective: Learn how to make your playbooks more dynamic with variables.**

- Topics Covered:
  - Declaring variables in playbooks
  - Passing variables at runtime

- Tasks:
  - Create a playbook with a variable for the package name (e.g., nginx)
  - Run the playbook with a different package name by passing it as a runtime variable

### **Level 7: Using Conditionals**

- **Objective: Learn how to perform tasks only when specific conditions are met.**

- Topics Covered:
  - Using the when clause in playbooks
  - Checking the return codes of commands

- Tasks:
  - Write a playbook that installs nginx only if itâ€™s not already installed
  - Add a task that runs a restart command only if the configuration file has changed

### **Level 8: Loops in Playbooks**

- **Objective: Learn how to perform the same task multiple times using loops.**

- Topics Covered:
  - Using the loop keyword in tasks
  - Working with item lists

- Tasks:
  - Write a playbook that installs multiple packages (git, curl, vim)
  - Create a playbook that adds multiple users to the system using a loop

### **Level 9: Creating and Using Roles**

- **Objective: Organize your playbooks into reusable roles for maintainability.**

- Topics Covered:
  - Role directory structure
  - Creating tasks, variables, and templates in roles

- Tasks:
  - Create a role to install and configure nginx
  - Use the role in a playbook to deploy a web server

### **Level 10: Templates and Jinja2**

- **Objective: Use templates to dynamically generate configuration files.**

- Topics Covered:
  - Creating Jinja2 templates
  - Using Ansible variables within templates

- Tasks:
  - Create a Jinja2 template for an index.html file
  - Deploy the template to /var/www/html/index.html on all managed nodes

### **Level 11: Handlers in Playbooks**

- **Objective: Learn to use handlers for performing tasks when specific conditions are triggered.**

- Topics Covered:
  - Defining handlers in playbooks
  - Triggering handlers using notify

- Tasks:
  - Write a playbook to restart nginx only when its configuration file is updated
  - Add a handler for reloading the service when the configuration changes

### **Level 12: Debugging and Error Handling**

- **Objective: Improve your debugging skills by handling errors gracefully.**

- Topics Covered:
  - Using the debug module
  - Ignoring errors and registering output

- Tasks:
  - Add debug messages to an existing playbook to print variable values
  - Write a playbook that gracefully handles failures during package installation

### **Level 13: Tags in Playbooks**

- **Objective: Learn how to selectively run tasks in a playbook using tags.**

- Topics Covered:
  - Adding tags to tasks
  - Running tasks selectively using --tags

- Tasks:
  - Add tags to tasks in an existing playbook (e.g., update, cleanup)
  - Run the playbook with specific tags (e.g., only run tasks tagged as cleanup)

### **Level 14: Ansible Vault (Encrypting Sensitive Data)**

- **Objective: Learn how to encrypt sensitive data in Ansible.**

- Topics Covered:
  - Creating encrypted files using ansible-vault
  - Editing and decrypting vault files

- Tasks:
  - Create an encrypted file with a database password
  - Use the encrypted file in a playbook to set environment variables

### **Level 15: Dynamic Inventory**

- **Objective: Learn how to use dynamic inventory for large-scale infrastructure.**

- Topics Covered:
  - Setting up dynamic inventory scripts
  - Using cloud-specific inventory plugins (e.g., AWS EC2)

- Tasks:
