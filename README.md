## **Introduction**

Ansible is a powerful, open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. If youâ€™ve ever felt overwhelmed by tutorials that jump around or if youâ€™re stuck in "tutorial purgatory," this repository is for you.

This project will guide you through a **task-based** approach to learning Ansible, one step at a time. Each "level" builds on the previous one, covering key concepts and providing actionable tasks to solidify your understanding.
